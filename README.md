Virtual-Memory-Manager
======================

The objective of this project is to implement a simple virtual memory manager “virtualmem” in C on a UNIX-based platform by setting one of these page replacement policies – FIFO, LRU-STACK(Least-recently-used stack implementation), LRU-CLOCK(Least-recently-used clock implementation), LRU-REF8(Least-recently-used reference 8 bits implementation), LFU(Least-frequently-used implementation), Optimal algorithms.
